# Background Roblox Multi-Instance

The other Multi-Instances on Github all have one thing in common, they spawn a Window you need to keep open. I find this annoying.

This one spawns an "Invisible" or "Hidden" Window, you can put this in startup or wherever, you can find it in Task Manager.

Teleports r iffy, nun I can do about that.
